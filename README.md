This package is a PHP library to generate ISO 20022 XML payment messages (pain.001) for use with Nordic and SEPA-compatible banks. It is based on the original [z38/swiss-payment](https://github.com/z38/swiss-payment) package and has been adapted to meet broader European use cases.

> ðŸ’¡ Maintained by [R52dev](https://github.com/r52dev) as a fork of `invoicery/iso20022-payment`, which itself was based on the original Swiss implementation by `z38`.

## Installation

Just install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) and run `composer require r52dev/iso20022-payment` in your project directory.

## Usage

To get a basic understanding on how the messages are structured, take a look [the resources](#further-resources) mentioned below. The following example shows how to create a message containing two transactions:

```php
<?php

use R52dev\ISO20022\BIC;
use R52dev\ISO20022\IBAN;
use R52dev\ISO20022\Message\CustomerCreditTransfer;
use R52dev\ISO20022\PaymentInformation\PaymentInformation;
use R52dev\ISO20022\TransactionInformation\BankCreditTransfer;
use R52dev\ISO20022\Money\DKK;

$payment = new PaymentInformation(
    'payment-001',
    'Acme Company',
    new BIC('NDEADKKK'),
    new IBAN('DK5000400440116243')
);

$transaction = new BankCreditTransfer(
    'instr-001',
    'e2e-001',
    new DKK(50000), // DKK 500.00
    'Philip Espersen',
    'Example Street 1, DK-1234 City',
    new IBAN('DK7620000123456789'),
    new BIC('NDEADKKK')
);

$payment->addTransaction($transaction);

$message = new CustomerCreditTransfer('msg-0001', 'From Acme Company');
$message->addPayment($payment);

echo $message->asXml();
```

**Tip:** Take a look at `Tests\Message\CustomerCreditTransferTest` to see all payment types in action.

## Caveats

- Not all business rules and recommendations are enforced, consult the documentation and **validate the resulting transaction file in cooperation with your bank**.
- At the moment cheque transfers are not supported (for details consult chapter 2.2 of the Implementation Guidelines)
- The whole project is still under development and therefore BC breaks can occur. Please contact me if you need a stable code base.
